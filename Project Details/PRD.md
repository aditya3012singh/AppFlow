Designing and coding Android app UIs with Jetpack Compose is time-consuming, error-prone, and demands technical expertise.

- Mobile app startups and agencies  
- UI/UX designers collaborating with developers  
- Tech educators and students  
- Teams needing rapid prototyping and design-to-code handoff

## 5. Goals & Objectives
**What do you want to achieve?**  
- Empower app creators to design modern Android UIs visually, with minimal code knowledge.
- Reduce development time and errors through instant code generation.
- Drive adoption by offering a freemium model where users can experiment before upgrading.
- Build a community around reusable composables and themes.
