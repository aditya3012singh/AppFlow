## Title
Implement Accessibility Checker

## Description
Add an automated accessibility checker to the App Studio. This tool will automatically analyze the userâ€™s design for common accessibility issues: color contrast, font size, touch target size, and other best practices. Warnings and suggestions should be shown in real-time in the UI, and users should be able to view details and suggestions for fixing issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Checks for color contrast (text/background), font size, and touch target size.
- Checks run automatically as user designs, with real-time feedback.
- UI warning indicators for detected issues, with clickable details/suggestions.
- Accessible and user-friendly design for the checker itself.
- Option to ignore/warn for each issue.
- Tests for checker logic and UI.
- Documentation for what is checked and why.
