## Title
Design UI Component Library (Material 3 Theme)

## Description
Develop a reusable UI component library for App Flow, using Material 3 design principles.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Core reusable components built (button, input, card, dialog, snackbar, menu, tab, etc.).
- All components follow Material 3 guidelines and are accessible (keyboard, ARIA, color contrast).
- Centralized theme files for colors, typography, shapes.
- Easy to override/extend theme for different branding.
- Components documented (usage, props, customization).
- Components tested (unit and snapshot).
- Library structure allows sharing between marketing site and studio.
