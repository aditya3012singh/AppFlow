# Task

## Title
Implement Export & Code Generation (kt file, bundled zip)

## Description
Allow users to export their designed screens as production-ready Jetpack Compose code. Export should include all relevant files (screens, assets, themes) bundled as a zip. Additionally, support copy-to-clipboard for code snippets. For free users, enforce export limits (e.g., 5 files/month) and implement gating. The export process must handle dependency imports and generate clean, readable, and idiomatic Kotlin/Compose code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Full screen export as `.kt` files with correct structure and imports.
- All assets (images, SVGs, fonts, etc.) and themes included in export bundle (zip).
- Copy-to-clipboard for current screenâ€™s code.
- Export/copy gating and limits enforced for free users (premium unlocks unlimited).
- UI feedback for export completion, errors, and limits.
- Backend logic for generating and bundling files.
- Tests for code generation, export zip, and gating.
- Documentation for export process and file structure.
