# Task

## Title
Testing and QA

## Description
Develop and automate unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests for all core features and flows of the application. Ensure all major user journeys are covered, including edge cases, error handling, and regression. Integrate tests into CI/CD pipeline for automated runs on every push/PR. Include usability and accessibility testing. Generate reports and track code coverage.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Unit tests for all business logic, UI components, and utility functions.
- Integration tests for API endpoints, authentication, export, and critical flows.
- E2E tests for key user journeys: login, design, export, upgrade, etc.
- Regression, error, and edge case coverage.
- Accessibility and usability checks for major screens.
- Automated test runs in CI/CD with pass/fail status.
- Code coverage reports generated and tracked.
- Test documentation and sample commands/scripts.
