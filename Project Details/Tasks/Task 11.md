## Title
Add Property and Modifier Editing Panel

## Description
Develop a dynamic panel within the App Studio that enables users to edit all parameters and Jetpack Compose modifiers for the currently selected composable. Changes should update the UI in real time (live preview). The panel must support a wide range of standard Jetpack Compose modifiers (padding, margin, alignment, background, size, etc.) and display only relevant properties for the selected element. Advanced: allow custom values, code preview of current modifier chain, and reset to default.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Panel appears and updates for currently selected composable.
- All relevant properties and modifiers (padding, margin, alignment, background, size, etc.) are editable.
- UI instantly reflects changes (live preview).
- Panel is context-aware (shows only relevant options for the selected component).
- Input validation for numeric, color, enum fields, etc.
- Option to reset each property to its default.
- Modifier chain/code preview updates as user edits.
- Accessible and keyboard-navigable.
- Unit and integration tests for panel logic and UI.
