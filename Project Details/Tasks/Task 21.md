## Title
Add Templates Library & Asset Library

## Description
Curate and implement a library of pre-built screen templates and a reusable asset library (icons, images, vectors) for users. Allow users to browse, preview, and import templates/assets directly into their projects. Templates should be categorized (e.g., onboarding, login, dashboard) and assets tagged for easy search. Support drag-and-drop or one-click import into user projects. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A library of screen templates, each with preview, name, and description.
- Assets library with icons, images, vectors, each with preview, tags, and license.
- Browsing, search, and filter capability for both templates and assets.
- Users can import templates/assets into their projects with one click or drag-and-drop.
- Imported templates/assets appear in the userâ€™s project and are usable in the layout canvas.
- Proper licensing/attribution for third-party assets.
- Tests for browsing, searching, importing flows.
- Documentation for using the template and asset libraries.
